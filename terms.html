    <div id="prep-ref">
      <h2> &#128062; Preparing Your References &#128062; </h2>
      <p>
        I would need a link to where your photos is stored. Places you can put your photos in is google drive,
        devianart, toyhouse, imbb, imgur.  Make sure to capture the whole body as much as possible. 
        The more detail and more photos the better and more accurate I can draw your characters. For photos please
        make sure that the animal is sharp and in focus. This is so that I can get the feel on the texture of the fur/ feathers 
        etc. If sending sketches of your character, please give me the overall shape of said character.
      </p>

       <p>
        Try to get many photos as possible. Preferly at various angles. Please keep all the photos in one files for each
        commission. Including any other reference such as stock images of cloths, enviroment pics etc. Please avoid using 
        any characters you own or dont have permission to do so. 
       
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Describing your character/pet</h3>
      <p>
        If unable to provide a visual reference, please give a good description of your character.
        what is their body type? fur? eye color? patterns? any special features such as missing limb?
        Here is a example of how you can describe your character:  Smokey is a characoal bengal male cat with 
        forest green eyes. His fur is curly and long and has a white underbelly and white tufts of fur on his ears.
        Smokey is a large tom with large paws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Describe thierr personality. You do not have to but it gives me a good idea on how to draw them.Like for example
        if one such character is kind and cheerful then I could draw them with round features or playful poses. are they
        grumpy? curious? loves to swim? etc.
      </p>

      <h3>Describing your commission</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to describing your character/pet. please desribe what you would like in your commisson.
        some guiding questions are as follows. What pose do you want? sitting? prancing? etc. What is the 
        enviorment like? expressions? It does not have to be long just a small description is needed that is all.
        You are allowed to give a small short sentence when submitting a form and giving more detail once you are 
        contacted.
